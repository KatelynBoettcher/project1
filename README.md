## TODO:
Determine individual Young's modulus of the 1000 samples in the `samples` directory, plus the average and standard deviation of these samples.


Let's make a plan today!

Young's Modulus of a material can be calculated from the slope of the elastic deformation region of a  stress-strain curve. This elastic deformation region is the straight part at the beginning
